HTML Project 1
==============

My first basic practice project since getting back into web development. Easy and straightforward. Create a site that looks exactly like the following: https://btholt.github.io/intro-to-web-dev-v2/news.html

I got pretty close then stopped when I got to a point where I'd just be making easy, but tedious changes like making each of the sections in the biggest box different colors. One big difference is that I didn't think a list would work for the colored box and used divs instead. Once I checked to src of the original I saw that he did indeed use a ul list. Personally, I feel like I took on a challenge making the list with divs and came out all the better for it.

After watching the solution though. I did notice that I had a lot of bloated css due to my inexperience. It has since been cleaned up.
